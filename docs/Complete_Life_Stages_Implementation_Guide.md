```typescript
export class CPFService {
  static calculateMonthlyContribution(salary: number, age: number): CPFData {
    // Implementation as shown above
  }
  
  static canWithdrawForHousing(cpf: CPFData, housingPrice: number): boolean {
    return cpf.ordinaryAccount >= housingPrice * 0.2; // 20% down payment
  }
  
  static calculateRetirementPayout(retirementSum: number): number {
    // CPF LIFE payout calculation
    return retirementSum * 0.004; // Simplified monthly payout
  }
}
```

### 2. HDB/BTO System
```typescript
export class HousingService {
  static applyBTO(player: Player): { success: boolean; waitTime: number } {
    const ballotChance = player.stats.wealth > 50000 ? 0.3 : 0.2;
    const success = Math.random() < ballotChance;
    const waitTime = success ? Math.floor(Math.random() * 24) + 36 : 0; // 3-5 years
    
    return { success, waitTime };
  }
  
  static calculateAffordability(monthlySalary: number, housingPrice: number): boolean {
    const monthlyInstallment = housingPrice / (25 * 12); // 25-year loan
    return monthlyInstallment <= monthlySalary * 0.3; // 30% of income
  }
}
```

### 3. NS System
```typescript
export class NSService {
  static determineVocation(player: Player): NSVocation {
    const { health, academicSkill, leadership } = player.stats;
    
    if (health > 80 && leadership > 70) return NSVocation.COMMANDO;
    if (academicSkill > 70) return NSVocation.SIGNALS;
    if (health < 50) return NSVocation.ADMIN;
    
    return NSVocation.INFANTRY; // Default
  }
  
  static calculateRankProgression(player: Player, months: number): NSRank {
    const performanceScore = (player.stats.health + player.stats.leadership) / 2;
    
    if (performanceScore > 80 && months >= 9) return NSRank.OFFICER_CADET;
    if (performanceScore > 60 && months >= 12) return NSRank.THIRD_SERGEANT;
    if (months >= 6) return NSRank.CORPORAL;
    
    return NSRank.PRIVATE;
  }
}
```

  Animated.spring(value, {
    toValue,
    friction: 8,
    tension: 40,
    useNativeDriver: true
  }).start();
};

// Achievement unlock animation
const animateAchievement = () => {
  Animated.sequence([
    Animated.timing(scale, { toValue: 1.2, duration: 200 }),
